# NAPYSOs
Here is the code for calculating Quasi-Periodicity (Q) and Flux-Asymmetry (M) that we used in our work investigating the variability of young stellar objects in the North American Nebula. 

We also included a custom style sheet `napyso.mplstyle` for replicating the figure aesthetic we strove for in our plots. See the [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html) for information on how to use it. 

Misc. Notes:  
* In our paper we adopted Q boundaries of ```[0.45, 0.87]``` and M boundaries of ```[-0.25, 0.25]```.
