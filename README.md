# NAPYSOs: About this project
Here is the code for calculating Quasi-Periodicity (Q) and Flux-Asymmetry (M) that we used in our work investigating the variability of young stellar objects in the North American Nebula. We thank John Bredall for sharing an initial version of the code for Q that we modified for this work. 

Misc. Notes:  
* In our paper we adopted Q boundaries of ```[0.45, 0.87]``` and M boundaries of ```[-0.25, 0.25]```.
