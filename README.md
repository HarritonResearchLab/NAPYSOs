Here is the code for calculating Quasi-Periodicity (Q) and Flux-Asymmetry (M) that we used in our work investigating the variability of young stellar objects in the North American Nebula. 

Misc. Notes:  
* In our paper we adopted the Q boundaries of ```[0.45, 0.87]``` and the M boundaries of ```[-0.25, 0.25]```.
