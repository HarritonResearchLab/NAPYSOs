# Notes

* **Schemes for QM Plots**: 
    * Colors and markers should be used as follows: 
        ```python 
        color_marker_dict={'p':['c0', 's'], 
                        'qps':['C1', 'o'],
                        's':['C2','*'],
                        'apd':['C3','D'],
                        'qpd':['C4','h'],
                        'b':['C5','d'],
                        'l':['black','p'],
                        'mp':['C6','P']}
        ```

        where seaborn has been preivously importated as ```sns``` 

    * Edgecolors should be black with linewidths set to ```0.5```
