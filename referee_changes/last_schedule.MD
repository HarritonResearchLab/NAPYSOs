# Owen To Do (After Above is Done)
- [ ] Make new appendix plots with exact same format as old ones, but names changed to new ones (see appendix A -- each figure is three square subplots, left is light curve, middle is phase folded (if the period is not nan), right is cmd.
    * the old code can be found here: ```.\recovered\2.0\efforts\xi\Misc\supplimentary_figures\make_sup_plots.py```
    * Something got messed up with the cmd diagrams last time I tried it...let me know how it goes. 
    * make sure to pay attention to inversion of axes where those exist, the labels (such as rounding of numerical values in title, period label, etc.)
- [ ] Choose five new objects to go in the appendix part of the paper and replace the current ones with them .. each should be unique qm class
    * Upload a compressed directory of the files to overleaf.
